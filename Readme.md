# Traffic Light Negotiation Using V2X Communication with 5G

This project demonstrates a **traffic light negotiation system** leveraging Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communication enhanced by **5G technology**. The system models real-world intersections using **MATLAB** and **Simulink**, simulating efficient and safe navigation under dynamic traffic conditions. Key features include **traffic light detection**, **vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V)** and **vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I)** communication, and ultra-low latency decision-making with 5G.

## Key Features

- **Traffic Light Negotiation**: Simulates interactions between vehicles and traffic lights for safe intersection navigation.
- **V2X Communication**: Implements V2V and V2I protocols for real-time data sharing between vehicles and infrastructure.
- **5G Technology**: Enhances communication reliability and reduces latency to sub-1 ms for critical traffic scenarios.
- **Dynamic Traffic Scenarios**: Handles complex intersections with multiple vehicles and dynamic signal changes.
- **Visualization**: Provides detailed views such as bird's eye, chase, and time-series graphs for traffic dynamics.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the project:

### 1. Clone the Repository
Download or clone the project:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/TrafficLightNegotiationUsingV2XExample2.git
cd TrafficLightNegotiationUsingV2XExample2
```

### 2. Open MATLAB
Launch MATLAB and navigate to the project directory:
```matlab
cd('C:\Matlab\TrafficLightNegotiationUsingV2XExample2');
```

### 3. Open the Project
Load the Simulink project:
```matlab
openProject("TrafficLightNegotiationWithV2X");
```

### 4. Open Key Subsystems
Use the following commands to access major components:
```matlab
open_system("TrafficLightNegotiationWithV2XTestBench");
open_system("TrafficLightNegotiationWithV2XTestBench/Sensors and Environment");
open_system("TrafficLightNegotiationWithV2XTestBench/V2V Simulator");
open_system("TrafficLightNegotiationWithV2XTestBench/V2I Simulator");
open_system("DecisionLogic");
```

### 5. Run the Simulation
Execute the helper function to analyze results:
```matlab
helperTLNWithV2XResults(logsout);
```

## Simulation Components

### 1. **Sensors and Environment**
Models the traffic light, road network, and surrounding vehicles. It generates real-time inputs for the systemâ€™s decision logic.

### 2. **V2V Simulator**
Simulates Vehicle-to-Vehicle communication by broadcasting Basic Safety Messages (BSMs) containing vehicle states (speed, position, heading, etc.).

### 3. **V2I Simulator**
Implements Vehicle-to-Infrastructure communication by transmitting Signal Phase and Timing (SPAT) messages from traffic lights.

### 4. **Decision Logic**
Processes input data from the V2X subsystems and sensor models to make decisions for the ego vehicle (e.g., stop, go, or decelerate).

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **File Not Found**:
   - Verify that the directory path is correct in MATLAB.
   - Use the `which` command to locate missing files:
     ```matlab
     which('TrafficLightNegotiationUsingV2XExample2')
     ```

2. **Undefined Function or Variable**:
   - Confirm that all required toolboxes are installed and accessible.

### Debugging Commands
```matlab
disp(logsout);
which helperTLNWithV2XResults;
```
